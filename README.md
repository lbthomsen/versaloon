About

JTAG Versaloon firmware for the STM32 Bluepill board.

Build
=====

Just a matter of `make -j` in the root folder if you have an ARM GCC toolchain installed on your computer. If you have docker, you can just run ```./build.sh```, it will build the firmware for you.

The produced binaries are the following :

```
Versaloon-STM32F103C8_BluePill.hex
Versaloon-STM32F103C8_BluePill.bin
Versaloon-STM32F103C8_BluePill.elf
```

Download
========

You can download the released firmware here: https://github.com/zoobab/versaloon/releases/tag/v1.0

Flashing
========

You can use st-flash with an Stlinkv2 adapter:

```
st-flash write Versaloon-STM32F103C8_BluePill.bin 0x8000000
```

Or alternatively, use an USB-serial adaptor, using the same method as for the
DirtyJTAG project with the ```stm32flash``` tool (see the section "Via a
USB-serial adaptor" in
https://github.com/jeanthom/DirtyJTAG/blob/master/docs/install-bluepill.md ):

```
$ stm32flash -w Versaloon-STM32F103C8_BluePill.bin -v -g 0x8000000 /dev/ttyUSB0
stm32flash 0.5

```

You can also do it via the docker container ```zoobab/stm32flash-docker```, or use the ```flash.sh``` script:

```
$ export DEVICE="/dev/ttyUSB0"
$ export FILE="Versaloon-STM32F103C8_BluePill.bin"
$ docker run --privileged -v $DEVICE:$DEVICE -v $PWD:/mnt zoobab/stm32flash-docker -w /mnt/$FILE -v -g 0x8000000 $DEVICE

/!\ This is not a Versaloon reserved VID/PID, disconnect any STM32 dev board from your computer before trying to use OpenOCD /!\

Pin map
=======

BluePill pin mapping is the same as MiniRelease1.h

```
TDI => GPIO B15
TDO => GPIO B14
TCK => GPIO B13
TMS => GPIO B4
```

OpenOCD config file
===================

Create somewhere a file called ```my_vsllink.cfg``` with this content :

```
interface vsllink
vsllink_usb_vid 0x0483
vsllink_usb_pid 0x5740
adapter_khz 100
transport select jtag
```

Then you can launch OpenOCD with `openocd -f my_vsllink.cfg` :

```

If you get the `Error: Can't find USB JTAG Interface!Please check connection and permissions.` error message, you may try to run OpenOCD as sudo.

Todo
====

* Does not build under ubuntu 16.04: https://github.com/zoobab/versaloon/commit/83dfb9bb8b72a99d491f8e34930afa46ff94adde
* Try it out on a discovery board: http://takenapart.com/?p=82
* Try it out on a maple board
* Try it out on a blackpill board
* Add some wiring/fritzing documention with some MIPS targets
* Make it work with urjtag, right now it trows an error for "jtag> cable vsllink error: Couldn't connect to suitable USB device. error: not found: no USB connections"
